View, visualize and transform data in the browser.

Data Explorer is a browser-based (pure HTML + JS) open-source application for
exploring and transforming data.

It works well with any source of tabular data. Load and save from multiple
sources include google spreadsheets, CSVs and Github. Graph and map data, write
javascript to clean and transform data.

Built on [Recline JS](http://okfnlabs.org/recline/).

## Use it

Visit <http://explorer.datahub.io/>

Want to use it locally? Just do "save as" and save the html (with all
associated files) to your hard disk. Note that for github login to work you
will need to have the app opened at a non file:/// url e.g.
http://localhost/dataexplorer.
